# Virtual Tourists App

This application was created purposely for the [Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com). This project firmed up my knowledge on creating anapplication that allows users to search for photos in different locations  and add top and bottom captions and then share them.


# Implementation

MapViewController.swift manages the pins.
SharePhotoViewController.swift  allows the users to add captions to the top and bottom and then share the edited photo
PhotoViewController.swift  manages the photos fetched by flicker and display them in collection view.

# How to build

UI creation -> assigning classes to each view controller -> creating outlets and actions -> using any necessarily protocols or libraries.
